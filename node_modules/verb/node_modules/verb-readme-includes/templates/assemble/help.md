## Bugs and feature requests

> Before creating an issue, please search to see if a related one already exists (oh, and you should know that every time an issue is created on the wrong repo, a programmer loses his beard. I'm so serious it's not even funny. His actual beard, gone. So please try not to do that.)

* For bugs and feature requests related to this project, please [create an issue here]({%= bugs.url %})
